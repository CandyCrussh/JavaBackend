dotnet framework components: 1. CLR(Commmon language Runtime) 2. FCL(Framework class library)

CLR:
1. CLI(common language infrastructure) 2. GC(Garbage Collector) 3. JIT(Just in time compiler):converts intermediate code to native or machine code

CLI:
1. CLS(common language specification) 2.CTS(common type system)

.NET is a S.W framework that includes everything that requires for developing application like web, desktop, mobile & IOT. It comes with single class library so weather you write code in VB,C# OR J# is doesn't matter.

>Features of .NET
1. Platform Neutral or Platform independent
2. It is a layer between OS and Prgramming language
3. It supports many programming language . such as C#, J#, F# and VB.
4. It provides a common set of class libraries which can be accessed from any programming language.

CLR Provides these Features:
:loading and execution of .net code
:memory isolation and management application
:verification of type safety
:compilation of intermediate language (MSIL code) into native execuatble code.
:automatic garbage Collector
:security
:interoperabilty
:managing execution and occurence of error and
:provides supports for debugging

In .NET , the code is compiled twice
1. In 1st high level code is compiled by the respective language compiler and the language compiler genrates intermediatecode which is also known as MSIL
2. MSIL is cinverted into Native Code using CLR
Always 1st compilation is slow and 2nd compilation is fast
